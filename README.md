## Features

- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor outdoor, hot water, flow, return, and other temperatures
- **Binary Sensors**: Track fault status, pump status, compressor status, and more
- **Number Entities**: Control setpoints like room temperature and hot water temperature
- **Select Entity**: Change operating mode (Heating, Cooling, Hot Water, Auto, etc.)
- **Write Protection**: Safety switch to prevent accidental changes to heat pump settings
- **Configurable Parameters**: Choose which parameters to expose through the options flow

## Supported Heat Pumps

This integration has been tested with:

- Heliotherm HP07S08W-S-WEB

Other Heliotherm and Brötje heat pumps with a serial or TCP interface should also work.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Setup

You need a serial-to-TCP converter (like [ser2net](https://github.com/cminyard/ser2net) or a hardware serial server) to connect your heat pump's serial port to your network.

Example ser2net configuration:

```yaml
connection: &htheatpump
  accepter: tcp,9999
  connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0,9600n81,local
  options:
    max-connections: 2
```

### Software Requirements

- Home Assistant >= 2024.1.0
- htheatpump >= 1.3.4 (installed automatically)

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the "+" button
4. Search for "Ht HA"
5. Click "Download"
6. Restart Home Assistant

#### Option 2: Add as Custom Repository

If the integration is not yet in the default HACS store, you can add it as a custom repository:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Click the **three dots** menu (top right) and select **Custom repositories**
4. In the **Repository** field, enter: `https://github.com/silviuk/htha`
5. In the **Category** dropdown, select **Integration**
6. Click **Add**
7. Close the custom repositories dialog
8. Click the **"+"** button to add a new integration
9. Search for "Ht HA" (it should now appear in the list)
10. Click **Download**
11. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/htha` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Ht HA"
4. Enter your connection details:
   - **Host**: IP address or hostname of your TCP/serial server
   - **Port**: TCP port (default: 9999)
   - **Timeout**: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10)
   - **Scan Interval**: How often to poll for data (default: 30 seconds)
5. Click **Submit**
6. Choose whether to enable writes (allows changing heat pump settings)
7. Click **Submit** to complete setup

### Options Configuration

After initial setup, you can configure:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Find your Ht HA integration
3. Click **Configure**
4. Select which parameters to expose as entities

## Development

### Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/silviuk/htha.git
   cd htha
   ```

2. Install development dependencies (if using Home Assistant development environment):
   ```bash
   pip install homeassistant
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
   ```

### Running Tests

The project includes tests for the config flow and coordinator:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest test_htha_config_flow.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Files

- [`test_htha_config_flow.py`](test_htha_config_flow.py) - Tests for the UI configuration flow
- [`test_htha_coordinator.py`](test_htha_coordinator.py) - Tests for the data coordinator

## Entities

### Default Entities

The following entities are created by default:

#### Sensors
- Outdoor Temperature
- Hot Water Temperature
- Flow Temperature
- Return Temperature

#### Binary Sensors
- Fault Status
- Heating Circuit Pump
- Compressor
- Hot Water Priority

#### Number Entities
- Room Setpoint Temperature
- Hot Water Normal Temperature

#### Select Entities
- Operating Mode

#### Switches
- Write Protection (controls whether changes are allowed)

### Operating Modes

The operating mode select entity supports the following options:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Off | Heat pump is off |
| Heating | Heating mode only |
| Cooling | Cooling mode only |
| Hot Water | Hot water mode only |
| Heating + Cooling | Both heating and cooling |
| Auto | Automatic mode selection |
| Emergency | Emergency operation |
| Standby | Standby mode |

## Time Programs

The **Time Programs** sensor exposes all time programs of the heat pump (e.g. `0 = Warmwasser`,
`1 = Zirkulationspumpe`, `2 = Heizung`) as attributes. They are refreshed once per hour and
immediately after a change made through one of the services below.

Days are numbered `0 = Monday` ... `6 = Sunday`. Times must be multiples of the program's step
size (usually 15 minutes). Writing requires the **Allow writing** switch to be on.

### Lovelace card

The integration ships a weekly time program card (loaded automatically, no extra resource needed):

```yaml
type: custom:htha-time-program-card
programs: [0, 1]          # optional: indexes or names, default all
state_names:              # optional labels per program index
  2: [Absenkung, Normal, Komfort]
```

It shows Monday to Sunday for every program as a timeline. Tap a day to edit its periods
(state, start, end); gaps are filled with state 0 automatically. *Apply to* copies the day to
other days. Saving requires **Allow writing**.

### `htha.set_time_window`

Sets one active window per day (off before, on inside, off after). Unused entries are filled with
`24:00-24:00`, exactly like the heat pump does. Only entries that actually change are written.

```yaml
action: htha.set_time_window
data:
  time_program: Warmwasser   # or 0
  days: [weekdays]           # all (default), weekdays, weekend, mon..sun
  start: "11:00"
  end: "15:00"               # "00:00" = end of day
```

### `htha.set_time_program_entry`

Low-level: changes one entry (`entry`, 0-based) of the selected days.

```yaml
action: htha.set_time_program_entry
data:
  time_program: Heizung
  days: [sat, sun]
  entry: 1
  state: 2
  start: "06:00"
  end: "22:00"
```

### `htha.set_time_program_day`

Replaces all entries of the selected days (used by the card).

```yaml
action: htha.set_time_program_day
data:
  time_program: Warmwasser
  days: [mon, tue]
  entries:
    - {state: 1, start: "04:00", end: "06:00"}
    - {state: 1, start: "09:00", end: "19:00"}
```

### `htha.refresh_time_programs`

Reads all time programs immediately, e.g. after changing them on the heat pump display.
All three services return the resulting time program(s) as response data.

## Write Protection

For safety, the integration includes a write protection feature:

- By default, writes are **disabled**
- Enable writes by turning on the "Write Protection" switch
- When writes are disabled, number and select entities will show an error if you try to change them

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure your Home Assistant instance can reach the TCP server
2. **Verify port**: Make sure the port is correct and not blocked by a firewall
3. **Check serial settings**: Ensure the serial port settings match your heat pump (typically 9600 baud, 8N1)

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging for more details:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.htha: debug
    htheatpump: debug
```

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect" error during setup**:
- Verify the host and port are correct
- Check that the TCP server is running
- Ensure the serial cable is properly connected

**Entities show "unavailable"**:
- Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
- Verify the heat pump is powered on
- Try restarting the integration

**Cannot change setpoints**:
- Make sure write protection is disabled
- Check that the parameter is writable (some are read-only)
